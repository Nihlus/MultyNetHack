# MultyNetHack
I'd like for us to make a multiplayer version of NetHack. 
It's a game made in 80s and nobody ever made open source multiplayer version of this gama. 
I started a project on Git, so if anyone wants to help: https://github.com/branc116/MultyNetHack 
Project is made in c#. 
Names of varibles/methodes/coments are in English, but I'm not native English speeker, so if you can't code you can still help by correct my gramauere and we can make the best open source NetHack game. 
If you can code, you can improve stuff in other branches and I'll take what works. :)
